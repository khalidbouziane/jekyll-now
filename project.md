iPython Tensorflow Notebook Tutorials
====================
![](/assets/tf.jpg) 

<a href="https://github.com/adeshpande3/TensorflowStuff/blob/master/ConvolutionalNeuralNet.ipynb" target="_blank">**Convolutional Neural Network Tutorial**</a> - This notebook shows you how to define a simple convolutional network using Tensorflow. We'll discuss how to load in datasets, how to create our network architecture using Tensorflow variables, as well as how to define loss functions and optimizers. 
<br><br><a href="https://github.com/adeshpande3/Generative-Adversarial-Networks" target="_blank">**Generative Adversarial Network Tutorial**</a> - This notebook shows you how to create a simple GAN. The basic idea is that you have 2 different networks, a generator network and a discriminator network. The discriminative model has the task of determining whether a given image looks natural (an image from the dataset) or looks like it has been artificially created. The task of the generator is to create natural looking images that are similar to the original data distribution. In this tutorial, we'll look at how to create both models, and the unique process of training them to reach a Nash equilibrium.
